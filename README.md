# NEC PC-8801 expansion protoboard
This board is meant to be a prototyping board for creating expansion cards for the NEC PC-8801 series of Japanese-market personal computers. It is intended to be a substitute for the Sunhayato MCC-151 prototyping board, which is (as far as I know) no longer available for purchase.

## Bill of Materials (Optional)
The card itself is enough, but you may wish to add a card ejector. I have tested it with the common and still-available Bivar CP-26 series.
