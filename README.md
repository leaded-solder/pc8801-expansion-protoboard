# NEC PC-8801 expansion protoboard
This board is meant to be a prototyping board for creating expansion cards for the NEC PC-8801 series of Japanese-market personal computers. It is intended to be a substitute for the Sunhayato MCC-151 prototyping board, which is (as far as I know) no longer available for purchase.

## Bill of Materials (Optional)
The card itself is enough for most users, but you may wish to add a card ejector in order to make it easier to insert and remove the card while you are prototyping your circuit. The 8801 _really_ gets a death grip on those cards.

I have tested fitment with the common and still-available Bivar CP-26 series ejector, so I suggest buying that. Installing the roll pins for the ejector lever is somewhat challenging for me, so I would appreciate any advice on how to make it faster and more consistent!

## Version History
### v0.3
 - Fixed the problem with the PC-8801 edge footprint where the "B" side pins were on the bottom ("A" side) and the "A" side pins were on the top ("B" side.) As you might expect, this kept things from working!
