 - [x] Figure out the edge connector tooth width and depth
 - [x] Figure out more exact dimensions (printout test-fit) of board edge
 - [x] Make an edge connector footprint
 - [x] Make a "power bar" footprint for 5, 12, -12, GND
 - [x] Copy net assignments to all of the power bars
 - [x] Make a "proto area" footprint
 - [x] Should the edge be chamfered?
 - [ ] Look at options for backplane covers
 - [x] Look at the thumb-release lever footprints, see if the screw holes can be tweaked (m3, 5mm ring)
 - [x] print, cut out, and test an example
 - [x] fix the alignment based on the SB-II measurements
 - [x] choose an ejector - Bivar CP-26 seems fine
 - [x] adjust PCB for ejector holes
 - [ ] send away for first revision...
